# Node.js Homework Assignment: Target Calculation Excluding Specific Days

## Description

This project is a solution for calculating the proportional distribution of an annual target across multiple months, but with specific requirements. The function calculates the distribution while **excluding Fridays** from the working days. This allows a company to calculate the target based on the number of valid working days in a given period.

The assignment involves:
- Calculating the total number of working days (excluding Fridays) for each month in the date range.
- Proportionally distributing the annual target based on these working days.
- Handling edge cases such as date ranges that start or end mid-month.
